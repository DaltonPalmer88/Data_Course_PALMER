#1 final_project_idea.txt

#2 my idea for the final project is to collect data from the Provo airport on temperature and humidity as well as collect samples of choke cherry trees which I can use to test their cyanogenic glycosides and see if there is any correlation between them.
#3 I am able to collect all the weather information from the national weather service. They have a website where I can download a csv file from the Provo airport which is near our population of choke sherry trees. My cyanogen glycoside levels will be analyzed in a lab from collected samples that will be collected and analyzed weekly.
#4 I have some data. I will download a weekly weather report and then hopefully I should be able to compile it all into one document at the end of the semester.
